###### What, exactly, is this book about?

This is, is essence, a 'How-To' book, but what it describes is so far beyond our current understanding of reality and our own being that it will sound like gibberish, or at best, grammatical madness, to many.  Even worse, of those who believe its claims and follow the instructions, some will loose their mind.

At the same time, life in the world we did know was not easy, and often very unconformable considering the only-recent advances in things like travel, plumbing, communication, comfort, entertainment, food, dental care, knowledge, healthcare, etc.  While even the modern poor live a life King Henry VIII would be envious of, we do not have anywhere near his burdens, let alone the burdens of the past poor.  This has made humanity soft, but it has also provided the luxury that allows almost anyone to spend decades exploring whatever they like.
