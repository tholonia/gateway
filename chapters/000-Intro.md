# INTRODUCTION
This book describes a technique, practice, method, of accessing an ancient form of consciousness.  This consciousness is one that our ancestors had far more access to and knowledge of, and as you come to understand this new form of consciousness, you will have a different understanding of history, evolution, and the deeper significance of myths, visions, legends and ancient wisdom.

This new consciousness in not an altered state, but an expanded state... think of it as your current “working” consciousness that has expanded into the *cognosphere*.  What is the cognosphere?  That is a term used to reference a world, or reality, or level of existence that exists between pure unmanifest energy and physical form.  Think of a car.  It is a thing that exists and is easily understood, but for that car to come into existence there are plans, theories, designs, tests, prototypes, and countless other systems that must be understood and managed.  All those concepts, ideas, theories, knowledge and understanding that exist between the idea of a car and the car itself is the cognosphere of a car.  Each thing exists within a cognosphere, including you. You have your own cognosphere, and while it is similar to other's cognosphere, each one is also unique. [^1]

Our ancestors were far more integrated with their cognosphere than modern western man, who has such a limited awareness of this concept as to be virtually cut off from the source and meaning of their existence.  For those who are aware, the cognosphere is well “beyond” or “behind” their daily operating consciousness.  This is why we refer to the cognosphere as the *meta-cognosphere*, as the Latin word “meta” means  *“situated behind or beyond”* (as well as *“transformation”* and *“more comprehensible, transcending”*). This is also why we'll use the shorthand word *MEX* to mean a *meta-cognosphere experience*.

There is also reason to believe that a MEX is a partial expression of *Kundalini* energy, the primordial cosmic energy and fundamental life force.  Regardless, what is a fact is that accessing and navigating the meta-cognosphere is for pioneers.

**For the Record**

Given some of the wild claims I make in this book, the reader may want to know a few relevant details about the author., me. I am a retired developer and entrepreneur who continues to dabble in programming, cryptocurrencies, and fringe research.  I was born in a New Jersey suburb in the ‘50s, grew up in a poor New England mill town, and settled in New York City where I raised a family of three with my wife before we divorced and I retired to Argentina. Being someone that was born “on the spectrum”, I was a terrible student, never graduated high school, and never fit into society’s norms despite my best efforts.  Since age six I have been having out-of-body experiences, and spent years studying various spiritual, occult, and mystical paths in an attempt to integrate these experiences into my reality, with little success. While I have had my share of profound and stupid drug-induced experiences, none of the experiences described in this book are related to drug use as I have not used any form of psychoactive drugs for many years, including marijuana.  I oppose rampant marijuana use, I respect ritual and enthogenic plant use, and I fully support psychoactive drug research as it holds tremendous potential for humanity. If you want to know more, you can read my autobiography “Legally Blind” [^2]

**On a more mundane note…**
