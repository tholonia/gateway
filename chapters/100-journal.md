###### Journal notes

What follows are the direct entries of selected journal entries regarding my meta-cognosphere experiences (MEX).

### August 23, 2020 (Moon Wax 37%)

> *Saw weak dot & circles. Focused until I saw the violet. Stayed with that until I found myself in another world floating over the a dark, seemingly dead and abandoned landscape of a formerly inhabited planet.  Housing structures were all below ground level with only small windows and the roofs above ground level.*  The landscape was dry and harsh, with no fight of vegetation, present or past.  Similar to eastern Sahara, or the Atacama desert in Chile, or even the images we have seen of the Mars landscape.
> &nbsp;
> *Exited, reentered.*
> &nbsp;
> *<img src='../Images/stars.png' style='float:right;height:200px'/>Found myself in a dark cave, at night. The roof of the cave had a large hole through which I could see the night sky.  Extremely beautiful.*  Tried to exit through the hole, but could not manage to move myself up.
> &nbsp;
> *Exited, reentered.*
> &nbsp;
> *Moved to a new some city park in the middle of the day, bright, people gathered for some sort of march, buildings, etc. All-in-all, a fairly typical day in a big city.*
> &nbsp;
> *Exited, reentered.*
> &nbsp;
> *I travelled over land like a filming drone, but only able to see out a limited "window" or field of view.  Appeared to be in some type of rural farmland, similar to that famous painting of a lone house on a hill ("Christina's World", Andrew Wyeth), but flatter.  Long, straight, narrow dirt roads, all very green. I realised I could control my direction of view by my intention towards an object, not by simply trying to change the field-of-view.  There had to be a focal point of attention which acted like an anchor or pivotal centre, such as a mailbox on the corner of a dirt road, a point in a creek, a rock, etc.*
> &nbsp;
> *Exited back to origin location.*
> &nbsp;
> *Found the purple light, but it was weak.*
> *Saw a form of a tetrahedron, black or shadowed, then a flood of other shapes followed.*
> *Violet light appeared, very strong an from different angles, sources.*
> *Heard a woman's voice explaining things - don't remember what she said.*
> *After a few moments of intense violet light my consciousness simply shut down, like passing out, at least that part that was aware of what I was doing.*

**Post notes:** This was one of the first explorations of this process.  This was a very long and intense session, so perhaps I blacked out because I reached my limit?  As fascinating as these experiences are, they do take a bit of a toll on my awareness, similar to how a child can become overwhelmed at a carnival, but I suspect this sort of 'travel' has other limitations I am not at all aware of.  For example, I learned there are limitations to movement, some based on my lack of ability, but other based on external conditions.  I had no idea where I would and up each time I reentered, or what abilities I may need. For example, I had no problem moving over the dead landscape or the city park simply by intention, but in the field, I needed to focus on objects, almost like sling-shooting myself from point to point.

### August 24, Monday, 2020, 16:00 (Moon Wax 37%)

> *Went to the rooftop and sat under the vert bright and hot sun.  Put on blinders to block the sun from my eyes.
> Began to see yellow targets with the violet inside.
> Saw an eye, with more violet inside eye.  With more focusing I could see part of the face.  It was old and fierce, but very beautiful.
> Saw eye inside black trigram.
> Target continued during conversation with Adri.*

**Post notes:** A 'target' is a visual focal-point.  Usually they are the bits of violet or purples, but this time they were yellow, with violet inside the yellow.  Perhaps because I was sitting outside under the sun?  The image of a single eye is such a classic image that it's hard not believe I saw it simply because it was ingrained into my own unconscious, even more so for eye in the triangle.  On the other hand, these are both archetypal images that one would expect to come across if they were travelling beyond this material world, like landmarks or buoys in the wilderness.  I was not surprised to see them, but I was surprised to see the (partial) face of the fierce, old and beautiful man.  Who was that?  What did he represent?  Never saw that face before.  The face was not in full technicolor, but in shades of blue-grey within the blackness.

Adriana was tending to the rooftop garden and we had a conversion while all this was happening.

### August 25, Tuesday, 2020, 12:00 (Moon Wax 45%)

>Violet "sprites", 3 or 4, descending from upper left.
>Opened portal to other place.
>Exceptionally immersive.  First saw smoke, then streets, canal, boxy building, and the military with guns on street during a demonstration.
>Saw Latin characters.
>Learned how to better move my vision with gentle and "sincere" intention.  It was like my awareness was a drone.

**Post note:** Usually the violet flames start from a centre point and grow, but this time the were incoming from the periphery of my vision.  In the world of NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming), moving the eyes to the upper-left represents a "visual construct", and indicates that "the brain is creating a visual image, something it hasn't seen before, a fantasy".  This makes sense, as I have to assume my brain is creating not only the images, but the whole immersive experience. As to whether this is a 'fantasy' or not, I guess time will tell.  To believe all creations of the brain are fantasies would be silly and dangerously shortsighted.

### August 26, Wednesday, 2020, 11:00 (Moon Wax 60%)

>Took some ashwagandh.  Felt that I  could see optic nerve better.
> &nbsp;
>Heard a voice that spoke in a fashion that similar to the style of the Wilhelm-Baynes translation of the I-Ching. Only remember last phrase: "Renew/Renovate/Revise your vision".  

**Post notes:** 'Ashwagandh' is a common and ancient nootropic herb used for stress, insomnia, blood pressure, immune system and calming the brain.  It is evergreen shrub that grows in Asia and Africa.  The voice did not actually say the words "Renew/Renovate/Revise". It was another word, or sound, that my brain understood as "Renew/Renovate/Revise". It seems I was being spoken to in a non-human language that I somehow understood on some level enough for my brain to know how to translate.

### September 4, Friday, 2020, 10:30 (Moon Wan 94%)

> *After an hour of attempting I stopped, took off bandanna, and rolled onto my side in defeat.  Immediately I saw some movement in centre of field of vision. As soon as I focused on it it became a "hole".  In the center was a night sky and one small star, or dot of light, similar to the cave hole, but far more dramatic.  Around the hole was wildly moving shapes, similar to fire, but only dark shapes. As I focused on the star I saw it begin to form more stars, then lines forming 2D shapes, then 3D shapes!*

*<img src='../Images/starspanel.png' style='height:200px'/>*

> *Then they seemed to move like constellations across the dark sky.*  
> &nbsp;
> *This state was remarkably stable, as I lost it a few times but was able to recover it quickly.*
> *After 10-15 minutes of this it changed to a flood of -- everything -- all shapes, things -- Some things I recognized, most things I did not.*
> *The hole and cave disappeared, but before that, the wild activity around the inside edge of the hole increased appearing almost violet or threatening.*
> &nbsp;
> *I attempted to get closer to the hole in the hopes of exiting through it, but it was difficult to know how to move.  Using intention I did get closer, but the movement was limited and haphazard. My first thoughts were "this must be the world of archetypes that Plato claimed was an actual reality"*
> &nbsp;
> *It is still a mystery to me how to invoke this state. It seems to happen randomly.  During this state there was a little bit of light in my environment which made the field of vision less black.  When I blocked that light, to increase the blackness, the vision diminished.  So... to much light or to little light is not conducive?*

**Post notes:** This flood of images seemed similar to an ayahuasca experience I had 15 years earlier, where... everything... was was being shown to me in an super-fast image sequence that after a few minutes I could no longer support.  In this experience it felt like only the archetypes were being shown to me, but while the 'reality' I was in was more immersive, the images were beyond the hole, and all in 1 or 2 colours, cyan-ish/green-ish - not violet.  Maybe sky-blue-ish.  

### September 4, Friday, 2020, 16:00 (Moon Wan 94%)

> *On the rooftop. For the first time I saw expanding circles, rather than contracting .  Very satisfying feeling.  After a few minutes I heard the words "Open your eyes".  I did not want to, and for a moment ignored the "message", but then did.*

**Post notes:** Up until this experience, the violet light was the result of the concentration of contracting waves. This was the first time I saw expanding waves, even though there was no bright violet light at all. I was experiencing this for only 10-15 minutes (I think) when I heard the message. This message was very clear, but also felt very distant.  

### September 9, Friday, 2020, 10:30 (Moon Wan 57%)

> *Contracting tunnel came on very fast.  Dark blue first, then violet. Entered quickly and saw a "reality" I choose not to enter... a thick gravestone with a cloth cover in a grave yard.  New/other realities did not appear.  Returned to tunnel entrance but only blackness appeared.  Then I saw a 1950's style space ship, lots of tubes and balls. Star-dots appeared, but faint and I was outside!*
> &nbsp;
> *Immediate fell asleep after experience... had dream.*
> &nbsp;
> *I S.F.? Had needle through my hand, by doctor. It was OK, no pain. It was some sort of treatment. (acupuncture point?). In hospital... met a ginger, nice. we talked, then he had to go into clinic, and it began to get dark - all were worried, then earthquake.  I collected my things, which took some time and was confusing due to the rubble, and headed outside. NEXT SCENE. In a small room, partly New York, Partly Buenos Aires. In one moment I turned around and the room was reversed. Bed was on left, and the loft, before before on the right, was also on the left. Everything was reversed... Nothing damaged, but a bottle of urine was broken. Lots of piss on the floor. Next to the broken was a simple mask, but I never saw it before.  Loft was not well fastened and kept falling.  Started to clean up.*
> &nbsp;
> *Note on ginger: we were talking abo1960sut his "ADD"? some sort of immune deficiency issues.*

**Post notes:** The transition from optic nerve to optic flame was very clear this time. This is what the optic nerve image looks like, and the flame-like form it transforms into. Both of these images are typically a bright violet.

<img src='../Images/nerve_flame.png' style='height:150px'/>

Unfortunately, I do not remember what "and I was outside!" refers to.  Outside the the tunnel? On the rooftop?  I also have no idea what "I S.F.?" refers to.  Perhaps it was a misspelled shorthand for "In San Francisco?", where I used to live.

<img src='../Images/handchip.png' style='float:right;height:150px'/>In retrospect, this dream is loaded with symbolism, and was possibly prophetic.  While COVID-19 had been around in the news since January, 9 months earlier, and masks were being discussed, it would be months before anyone started getting injected with the vaccine, if that is what the needle in my hand represented.  On the other hand, I learned months after this dream that the location of the injection in me dream is where RFID chips are inserted with a syringe.  

In the original note I put a question mark next to 'ADD' because even though I heard with words 'ADD', it was not clear why we would be speaking about *Attention Deficit Disorder* with regard to immune deficiency.  However, *Antibody-Dependent Enhancement*, or 'ADE' as it is commonly called, applies perfectly, and is now a major problem with regard to the mRNA vaccines.  It may be that I heard 'ADE' in the dream, but wrote down 'ADD' because it was the only acronym that I knew at the time that sounded similar.

The earthquake could also be symbolic, as in a seismic social event resulting in a lot of broken and collapses institutions.  Or, it could be literal, and an earthquake is imminent. If I was in San Francisco, that would not be that unusual at all.  If there is an earthquake in San Francisco, prepare for a world of bio-chips and billions of sick and dead people from the mRNA vaccines.


### September 14, Monday, 2020 10:30 (Moon Wan 11%)

> *Began immediately after waking.*
> *Saw pupil briefly, and it became a windows into other worlds. I didn't enter, but got closer.  Boats?*
> *Saw tetrahedron of light, also pyramids, and what might have been a simple thologram. Placing my awareness on it caused it to grow very fast into what looked like a giant molecule with countless generations.*
> *After the pupil, the violet light came. The light was more cyan-ish, sky-blue-ish.*
> *Was slightly more able to control its vision,  became very bright and persistent at times.*

**Post notes:** Over time, it was not uncommon to see the 'pupil', or hole, or tunnel-opening without seeing the violet light initially. The  geometrical shapes was becoming more prominent in my travels, but this may also be because I had just written a book that dealt with geometry and consciousness, which introduced the idea of a 'tholon', a self-similar tetrahedron.

### September 16, Wednesday, 2020 10:30 (Moon Wan 0.9%)

> *Difficult to enter.  Saw 'pupil' and flame as two different things interacting with each other, but they were not being very compatible.  The pupil would eclipse the flame, and the flame would block the pupil.  I had to choose if I wanted to enter via the pupil or the flame.  I Choose flame... normal visions followed.*
> &nbsp;
> *Then saw stars through 'broken ceiling', but this time I could pass through the hole and enter the sky.  The sky was filled with stars, and also a planet. Approached the planet. At first it was hard to say if the planet's was organic or was created, but when I 'entered' the planet, I found myself in a crappy Korean supermarket.*

### September 17, Thursday, 2020, afternoon, (Moon NEW 0%)

> <img src='../Images/fabrege.png' style='float:right;height:130px'/>*Had very weak vision of 'ceiling hole', but in that moment a striking image appeared, like a Faberge decorated Easter egg, then other similar designs.  I was surprised by their clarity of the object and uniqueness or design... something I would never thought to imagine.*

### September 21, 2020, (Moon Wax 24%)

> *Took almost an hour.*
> *Orion? pulsing light and dark.*
> *Eye eclipses the light.*
> *Blue, cyan, violet.*
> *Light most intense*
> *Vision of woman/angel on other side of void.*

**Post notes:** This time the stars looked like the constellation of Orion (below).  the word 'eye' also refers to 'pupil' and 'opening of tunnel', and the words 'light' and 'flame' are usually synonymous.  This was the first time I saw a being across the void or darkness.

<img src='../Images/orionstars.png' style='width:50%'/>

### September 26, 2020, (Moon Wax 76%)

> *Tunnel appeared spontaneously but could not focus to point.*
> *Very difficult to 'enter', focus point would evaporate before focusing.*
> *Large deep blue 'ether field'.*
> *Saw flames, holes, field, all interacting - more chaotic than normal.*
> *Saw star, it showered light on me... made my body very excited, but I saw this light when I was OOBE with Mariano and Another programmer at job site/office.*
> *Great torrent of chaotic energy, forming light... a storm, but beautiful.*

### October 1, 2020, (Moon FULL 100%)

> *Closed eyes in bed, immediately saw eye and flame, but there was a lot of ambient light to I moved to get my bandanna and then it was gone. It seems to act like a wave, perhaps with crests and tides. When I tried to replace round hole with a triangle it worked but I got a bad headache*
> &nbsp;
> *Hole and flame have direct and opposing interaction, like sun and moon.  Flame behind hole, then hole behind flame.  Flame never in hole.  Flame exists in the "space", but hole, which acts as three-dimensionally, is a door to another 'space'.*
> &nbsp;
> *It's clear that the three stars I am seeing are those of Orion, and the one that shown its light on me was the star in the middle, 'Alnilam', the brightest of the three starts in Orion's Belt, which was also where the Ancient Egyptians believe souls came from.*

<img src='../Images/map_1.png' style='height:300px'/>



Post note: Sometimes it takes an hour to get to the light, sometimes instantly.   Times of easy access, and times of difficult or no access, similar to tides, but of unknown cycle. The reference to "When I tried to replace round hole with a triangle" refers to the ability to change the shape of 'object' in the void, including the 'hole' itself, simply by use of focus and intention, and, I suppose, will. The relationship between hole flame is clearer, and is seems they are two sides of the same things, the two contrasting and cooperating aspects of whatever this reality is they exist within.  On one side, an all-seeing eye, perhaps, in that it is a portal to (conceivably) anywhere, and on the other side, the flame, energy, that seems to be constrained to  it's domain (unlike the eye).

Orion would return a number of times in the starts, so much so it seemed far more that just a coincidence.

The chart is a cleaned up version of a first attempt to understand the processes, step or stages involved with these experiences but a more acute is charts is something like:

### October 3, 2020, (Moon Wan 92%)

> *Saw blue wave spontaneously.  Began.*
> *Slow progress, slight at first.  Standard elements... fig, shapes, light, tunnel, hole, stars.*
> *Through chaos to flame to hole.  Inside hole, three stars.*
> *Centre started expanding, like looking into a laser beam.*
> *Then back to dot, then again.*
> *Light was vert bright*
> &nbsp;
> *<img src='../Images/alien_eyes.png' style='float:right;height:100px'/>At one point I saw beings in the light, their eye shape stood out.  Definitely alien looking, like tall Zeta, or Grey Type B Aliens.  2 or 3 of them. The experience ended and could not get it back.*

### October 12, 2020 (Moon Wan 23%)

> *Very active and intense, many "domains", also a lot of pyramids.*
> *At end, I saw a door to street like I was in a bank. entered vision... entire body... collapsed. Held myself up, but vision went blurry, they turned grey.  Looked like "I" was dying.*
> *'Alien' gave me a box. Inside was a beautiful green quartz crystal.*

**Post notes:** This quartz was remarkable, and I have yet to find a sample that matches its beauty.  I can only assume that it was given to me for its esoteric properties (clarity of thought, psychic healing, heart chakra). I did not see the 'alien' that gave it to me.  It simply appeared and it was 'known' to me that is was a gift from a particular 'alien'.

The experience behind the words '*entered vision... entire body... collapsed*' wasn't frighteningly profound and left a mark on my psyche to the extent that I was hesitant and/or unable to induce an experience for the next 10 months.  The implications of what I just experienced, as exciting as they were, rattled the very foundations of how my understanding of existence.

The reality I had entered appeared to be a small community bank in some rural area, like the farm lands of Nebraska.  In front of me was an old man walking towards the door.  Although I didn't intend to enter into this man's body, I did. Perhaps I don't remember that intention, or perhaps it just happened naturally for reasons I don't understand.  I am still not sure.  In any case, I did.  This was the first time I entered into a body of another being, at least to my recollection. It took me just a moment to 'adjust' myself to his body, and once I did I could see the same scene of the bank doors but through his eyes.  At that moment my physical body, which was sitting crossed legged on my bed in Argentina, totally collapsed.  And by totally, I mean, all my muscles stopped working. It was as if my body died, but just for a second or two.  My body had fallen to the bed,   but I quickly recovered, yet remain in the experience the whole time. Quickly, the my sight through the old man's eyes began to blur, and  over the next seconds, faded to complete gray.  I stayed in the experience a little longer, but it was clear that this experience was over, or rather, the host was over.  It was as if the part of my brain merged with part of his brain, but his brain had died.  Had I just experienced the death of this man through his eyes? Did he die at that moment, and is that way my body collapsed? did my entering his being contribute to his death? Was I drawn into his being because he was dying?  

I spent the next 10 months pondering these questions. I came to an understanding of what happened, or at least a hypothesis, but the larger questions remain... can other consciousnesses enter and exit our being at will? And if so, can  they exert their will?  This is pretty much the description of we have called 'possession', and it usually doesn't end well, but perhaps we are all hosts to visiting consciousnesses and just don't know it because our visiting consciousness is not malevolent, and is probably well intentioned, as I was.  

### July 19, 2021, (Moon Wan 74%)

> *From the void emerged the eye of a woman followed by many beautiful faces (of women).  This was followed by images of gods, titans, demons, heroes, villains.  
> Array of different coloured forms that seemed like blueprint-of-life stuff.*
> *Followed by 'scar-faced' aliens inside the hi-tech space ship, with with changing coloured light reflecting off their faces from the spaceship window.*
> *Each colour seemed to have a relationship with their forms.  For example:*
> *Reddish-violet light: randoms and chaotic forms of light, flares that looked like optic nerves. Impossible to predict their movement, but somewhat form-able with awareness.*
> *Light-blue: Organic, structured forms usually smooth and often with fine detail.*
> *Dark blue: Simple archetypal structures* 
> *Yellow: Organic, archetypal? Forms of early life?*

**Post notes:** The journey seemed very coherent, in that it seemed to follow a very cl;ear path from the void -> eye -> woman -> gods -> design of life in action -> ending with some aliens you wouldn't want to bump into in some dark corner of reality watching something very colourful and active.

### July 29, 2021 (Moon Wan 68%)

> *Saw a gateway light - very blue.* 
> *Then was in a fairly dark room, like a small town bus station.* 
> *Others were there waiting. I wondered if I should also be waiting, but for what I didn't know,  and where this was.*  
> *Started to interact with some of the others.*
> &nbsp;
> *Found myself trying to fit some sort of cloth rope to a woman, and in the process she exposed her ass to me, as if inviting me. Left that situation, and began talking to some of the others nearby, who seemed quite friendly.  One women sitting on couch, 30-40 years, attractive, typical body, short-ish blond hair, was very easy to talk to.  Her name was "Krats" or "Kots" or "Krat".*
> &nbsp;
> *Totally aware I was in this alternate plane and also in my body.  Came back to body, but still saw visions of sculptured faces lit by a bright, altering light.  Blue-grey faces, smooth... began to become slightly animated, as if coming to life.*
> &nbsp;
> *At one point I was in darkness and felt surrounded and was being touched and moved by a number of other beings I could not see, which made me a bit uneasy.  Decided this would be a good time to leave my body, if for no other reason to get away from these "others", but also so I could see who/what these others were.  But leaving my body landed me in yet another room, a tent actually, that was filled with violins on display. A man entered, seemed like a salesman, but he gave me a violin in a case, and led me into another room where I sat down on the couch.   I opened the violin case and took out what I intuitively knew was a "Venezuelan sitar", which I knew at the time does not actually exist.  It was like I had two separate consciousnesses in two worlds, each aware of the other.  I gently touched the strings, which were old and even slightly rusted, but the music is made was unlike anything I could have imagined... mystical, hypnotic, magical.  I continued touching the strings, but was interrupted and ended up in another room full of people, and there was even a band.*
> &nbsp;
> *I tried to float, and did so for a bit (suggesting I was OOB, but not aware of it at the time), but was interrupted by something/someone jumping on my back.  I was not nervous or sacred.  On the contrary, whatever it was felt quite nice to be on me.  I could feel the cheek of a face behind me touch the side of my face.  I knew it was a woman.  I touched her face with my hand, which remarkably soft and pleasing to touch.  I told her such, still not seeing her face.  She was pleased  There was an instant connection with this unseen creature on mu back.  I asked her "Where are we?  Where is this place?"  She replied "Let's not talk about that now", and I headed towards the nearest couch.*  
> &nbsp;
> *On the way I passed a TV screen that was broadcasting mainstream-media-type news coverage of a demonstration with fire and violence at "Bethesda on Hastings".  This seemed like it was news from the world I came from, but I have no idea of its source.*
> &nbsp;
> *I flung her on the couch and saw her face and body for the fist time.  She was thin, small breasts, wavy blond hair medium length, and, to my eyes, very beautiful.*
> &nbsp;
> *It was clear to both of us we were going to connect intimately... and we did.  In the course of our frolicking I moved my physical body's arms by mistake, and ended up back in my original body.*



**Post notes:** Bethesda is in Maryland, and the word itself means "House of mercy" in Greek,  and Hastings is in England and famous for the *Battle of Hastings*, but other than that, I have no idea what 'Bethesda on Hastings" could mean.

During the frolicking, I was surprised to realise that I had very little physical sensation, at l;east compared to my normal physical body. This is another indication I was having an OOBE.

It felt like I was somewhere in Northern Europe/Scandinavia and I suspect that I was in a place that the Hebrews call "Shoal", a place where the less-than-pure dead wait until it is time for them to leave... it's not a hell, or a heaven, just a holdover reality, and really not that different from the reality we live in every day.

### Dream Response

After several days of unsuccessful MEX attempts, I had a dream.  Typically I would not refer to dreams as any sort of reference, given their subjective nature, but in this case, the dream seemed to address questions that had been growing in my mind concerning MEXes.  The images in this dream may be subjective, but the general message of the dream was not, ans was as follows:

I was a "traveller" whose home base was a very advanced and organised world.  Travellers, which were something like a class of astronauts, more or less, would be sent to various unknown locations from this world. 

Travellers would prepare for a journey by entering a life-support pod and ready everything for departure.  Once ready, the pod, as if knowing when all was ready, sealed itself shut and departed.  The traveller had no idea of the destination or any specifics about where it was going to land. Once the pod landed, it unsealed itself, allowing the doors to open and releasing the traveller to explore in whatever manner he chose.  

As my pod began to descend to my destination, I choose to look out a small window to see where I would be landing.  This was the first time I had ever chosen to view my landing, as it was custom to sit and wait until the doors opened.  I saw I was descending onto a tropical beach and was excited to have the luck be landing in such a beautiful location.  Previous journeys had landed me in cities, industrial zones, and other inhospitable areas, so this was a refreshing change.  

I felt the pod land, but as it was coming in fast and shallow, it continued to slide into the ocean.  The pod was only half-submerged, but it was enough to prevent the door from opening.  I wondered what I was going to do... and that is where the dream ended.

I awoke with the knowledge that this dream was a response to my questions, and its meaning soon became clear once I stopped focusing on the details of the dream.  In the language of my own cognosphere, what I was being shown was the life of a seed.  

The seed is a self-contained pod that gets dropped somewhere it has no control or knowledge of.  Once settled, it attempts to sprout.  Depending on its environment and other factors, it will grow or die.  If it does grow, it may, or may not,  exist long enough to create new seeds.  In this dream, I was a seed, or rather, the intelligence within the seed, which I perceived as the pod.  

When we look at nature, we see many different types of life, each with its own form of seed; pollen, acorns, sperm, etc.  If we expand our view, we can see how the simple seed/egg or yang/yin concept applies to all forms of creation, from galaxies to ideas.  From our daily close-up view of reality, we see each seed as unique to the form of life it comes from; acorns from oak trees, pollen from flowers, etc. From the expanded view, we can imagine how ALL seeds come from a highly structured and organised 'source' if for no other reason than they all operate by the same laws of DNA.  

How did this dream shed light on the nature and significance of a meta-cognosphere experience?

We are, by nature, seeds, and like a seed, we carry an intelligence within which is the driving force behind our nature to expand, grow, continue, thrive.  Some seeds will manage to produce new seeds.  Some will die. Some seeds will land on fertile ground, and others will land in the crack of a sidewalk, or a dessert ocean, or be eaten (possibly to be crapped out later over yet another unknown location).  

*(Interesting bit of trivia: 1 in 7000 dandelion seeds  travels more that 1 kilometre, and 1 in 4 of those seeds will germinate IF they land in a compatible environment.)*

The "failure" of a seed to sprout and grow is not necessarily the failure of the seed itself but the environment it was dropped into.  But this failure is as significant as any success, as it defines the limits or frontier of growth.  More importantly (for our purposes), within each seed is the intelligence that comes from (or is a part of) the source, whatever that is, and will return to the source, regardless of its success or failure in the field.

Had I landed just a few meters short of the water, my pod would have opened to a paradise.  Instead, I was half-submerged in a pod that would not open and was left with the challenge of how to deal with this challenge, how to survive, how to continue my journey. 

Given that we have no control at all as to where we land in the spectrum of existence, we can't judge our value by our circumstances but only by how we deal with our circumstances.  This is the great illusion of our time, for we have forgotten that we are seeds, messengers, of the source. 

This is the essence of a MEX. We are connecting with that part of our higher, inner, or guiding intelligence, whatever you prefer to call it, whose purpose is to travel from place to place, reality to reality.  But to what end? What is our 'mission' or purpose?  Empirically speaking, it seems to be simply to grow, to experience, to explore in whatever manner we choose to.  Even though each of us may be the captain of our ship, some strategies are more effective or compatible than others.  

An example of this that comes to mind is that of Mahatma Gandhi, who believed that violence is an effective strategy, but peaceful protest is more effective.

>"Thus when my eldest son asked me what he should have done had he been present what I was almost fatally assaulted in 1908, whether he should have run away and seen me killed or whether he should have used physical force, which he could and wanted to use, I told him it was his duty to defend me even by using violence...Hence I advocate training in arms for those who believe in the method of violence... But I believe nonviolence is infinitely superior to violence... forgiveness may be more manly than punishment."

> *Again, no light, or very little, same as yesterday.  However, this time I found myself in a room, black and white, and very 19th century French by the looks of the decor.  Through a round hole in the wall came some very 19th century French men, again, based on the clothing.  I guess they could have been English as well, given my poor knowledge of ridiculous fashions of history.  The man exited the hole, stood, and looked at me as if grateful I gave him the opportunity to enter this "place".  He was in his mid to late '30s, 5'10' perhaps, 180 lbs, given his bit of a belly. White coiffured hair, but didn’t look like a wig.  After arriving, he stood rather "royally" and placed his elbow on a 4' high hearth as if posing for a picture.*

> <img src='../Images/portrait.png' style='float:right;height:300px'/>*The scene started to change a lot, but lots of noise, no signal. Occasionally I could focus on what seemed to be an old TV broadcast, also seemed French or European, based on the small, white sedan cars, 1960s style (again, based on my very limited knowledge of cars in Europe).  This looked like a news station airing a live broadcast of a procession.  Lots of people.  Lost focus.  Came back for a moment, but it seemed like this had something to do with an assignation (of someone in the cars?) that was about to happen. Lost focus again. These scenes kept coming in and then getting lost in the noise, static.* 

**Post note:** After a little research, it seems the man’s dress and hair was closer to a late 17th/early 18th century colonial man of authority or wealth, perhaps a politician.  Here is a hobbled draft that generally captures his fashion, style, and form as seen in the vision.

>*Very difficult time getting to light.  Tried for perhaps an hour.  While I could not get to the light, I seemed to be dropping into 'visions' easily.  By 'vision' I mean not an immersive experience, more of a remote observation looking at a soldier from the side.  All B&W. He did not look like a normal human...  odd, inner-curved nose.  He stood at attention.  This felt like some sort of dystopian police state, with these odd-humans as the police class.  He reported himself to me as "M1-4239".*
> &nbsp;
>*After trying for an hour, I just gave up and instantly was hit with unusually clear and bright violet light.  Work with that for 10 minutes or so. I kept losing focus, but it never seemed to move me to the portal.*
> &nbsp;
>*Some moments later, I tried again.  I closed my eyes and immediately saw a very specific pattern of dots/stars.  This was an immersive experience but happened instantly.*

**Post notes:** The dots reminded me of both toad eggs and aboriginal/ancient dot painting. They also looked remarkably similar to human *gyri*, or the folds found in the human brain. 

<img src='../Images/brains.png'>

To my surprise, I learned that aboriginal dot painting only began in the 1970s, but the ancient dot paintings are some of the oldest creations of man, with the oldest cave painting on record to be just a single red dot, as shown below in the ‘El Castillo Cave’ image.

<img src='../Images/dots_cavepaint.png'>

This opens an interesting thread of speculation because as time advanced, dot drawings appeared to evolve from one dot (38,000 BC), to dot-only animals (31,000 BC), to animals with dots and shapes (27,000 BC).  Notice in the last image that the dots which form the horse exist well outside the shape of the horse.  What was the artist trying to portray? Surely, the dots were not meant to be a simple outline of the animal but appears to represent something that the horse exists within.  

Is it possible that our ancient Ancestors saw these dots patterns in their own visions? In the case of the horse, was the artist letting us know these dots he saw represented a pattern of a horse and was not, as current thinking goes, attempting to reproduce a spotted horse, but didn't know to keep the spots on the horse and not place them all around the horse?  

Given that indigenous and ancient symbols can be found all over the world that correlate to modern patterns, such as DNA, cosmology, biology, energy, etc., we might conclude that our ancestors had access to some universal knowledge that they could only interpret through the lens of their own abilities... just as we do today.

<img src='../Images/blanchard.png' style='float:right;width:50%'>Another example of this might be the 30,000-year-old *Abri Blanchard Bone*, which shows a pattern of dots that current thinking suggests was a lunar calendar, and remember that this was made around the same time as the painted horse.  Are we asked to believe that our ancestors who could not draw within the lines were able to calculate moon phases?  I suggest it was a vision of unknown significance at the time of its creation (and question the validity of its current interpretation)
