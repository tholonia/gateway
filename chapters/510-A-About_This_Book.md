## Writing Style

For those readers who are sticklers about writing style conventions in the U.S., I have deliberately chosen to place punctuation (that is not part of a quote) outside of quotes.  The convention of placing punctuation inside the quotes was adopted due to the limitations of fixed width fonts in the pre-digital age.  The British convention has punctuation outside of quotes, but that is because they use single quotes, not double quotes.  To quote William Strunk and E. B. White, “Typographical usage dictates the comma be inside the marks, though logically it seems not to belong there”.  I agree, and take the side of Canadian poet, typographer and author Robert Bringhurst who bravely stated that it “makes no *typographic* difference” if quotation marks “follow commas and periods or precede them”. Also, I follow periods with two spaces, not one.  The two-space rule was also in place due to fixed width fonts, but unlike the punctuation-quotes rules, it has fierce opposition with both sides claiming victory. Even the American Psychological Association has gone from officially recommending one space, then recommending one *or* two spaces, then back to two spaces (in their 6th addition), then back to one space (7th edition). This does not inspire confidence in their craft. I will be using two spaces because it has been shown that using two spaces after a period increases text processing ability[^1].  In addition, while it is customary to spell out numbers in a sentence, for the most part, numbers in a sentence will be shown as numerals. This is to allow for numerical values to be easily recognizable, which, like the above point, increases text processing ability.
